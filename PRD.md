# Hi Perplexity,

Can you please generate me a PRD for a law firm. What I would like to do is to create your website. The idea of the website is to ensure that it's comprehensive, fully detailed, and I will give you a document with all the necessary information about the business and use that document to generate a full five-page website. Comprehensive and detailed.

In the PRD, please add functionality and avoid gradient colors. Ensure that the colors are clean colors, using this 60/30/10 rule when it comes to colors. Animations are a must; they need to be properly integrated in the website. We need a website with dark and light theme as well.

And yeah, here is the rest of the information that you can use to generate the PRD. About Us
